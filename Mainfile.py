The Climavue sensor measures all main meteorological parameters, and the apogee sensor records solar groundwave radiation. The instrument also has a raingauge and a lightning detector. The sensors make recordings that are collected by the CR350 data loggers which store and transmit the data. The data loggers are configured to transmit to the public server hosted at Turkana Basin Institute using the safaricom network. Stations are collecting data every 10 minutes and up to 3 months of data can be stored on the internal hard disk. The size of data collected is small ~ 10KB per hour. Each station has been secured based on the needs of its locality - i.e. what the highest risk of interference in the region is.")

The samburu are traditionally pastorolists and this continues to be the major economic activity in the mountain and surrounding regions. Camels, goats and cows graze up to the very top of the mountain. Water scarcity is a big problem facing the community, with only a small stream originating in the mountain top. The area is semi-arid, though the mountain hosts diverse vegetation and is up to **10** degrees cooler at the top. The highest peak at Mt Nyiro has an altitude of 2848m." )

Camp was set up for 3 nights and installation was done within 2 days. Students took measurements of weather data on hand held devices as a test of current conditions. Once the mast was secured and the data logger attached with sensors, the solar panels were set up. This completed the installation and the team descended the following day.")
